    <h1>Phoebe Nichole B. Lozada</h1>
    <p>
      Hi, my name is <em>Phoebe Nichole Baroy Lozada</em> and I'm a nail artist.
      I started doing nail extensions as a way to express my creativity and to
      honor my grandfather, <em>Eugenio</em>, who passed away. I have always had
      a passion for beauty and fashion, and I saw nail extensions as a way to
      bring together my creative skills and my love for making others feel
      confident and beautiful.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      The strength that inspires me to do this is my grandfather, whose name was
      Eugenio. He was a loving and caring person who always encouraged me to
      follow my dreams and to never give up on what I love.
      <strong
        >To pay tribute to him, I named my nail business "Nails by E", which
        stands for "Nails by Eugenio".</strong
      >
      This name is a constant reminder of my grandfather's love and support and
      it keeps me motivated to keep creating beautiful and unique nail designs.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      I take pride in my work and I always strive to create the best possible
      experience for my clients. Whether it's creating a unique design for a
      special occasion or simply enhancing someone's natural beauty, I am
      dedicated to making sure each of my clients leaves feeling confident and
      beautiful.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Thank you for taking the time to read about me and my passion for nail
      extensions. I look forward to helping you bring your vision to life.
